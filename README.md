# CodeG

Your G when it comes to coding

CodeG is a terminal-based AI chat application that helps you code. Like Cursor, but in your terminal.

### TODO:
- Write real documentation for the project here :)
- Add accept/decline file changes with diff view
- Add execute command tool with accept/decline
- Add attach file as context functionality, like in cursor. Perhaps done by @ ing the file/folder
- Switch to a more advanced terminal UI like ratatui? This may be needed for making diff view collapsible and stuff like that.
- Add a configuration module for handling API key parsing from environment variables and perhaps other configuration like model and auto accept
