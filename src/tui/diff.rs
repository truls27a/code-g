/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use code_g::tui::diff::Diff;
///
/// let path = "example.txt";
/// let before = "line 1\nold\nline 3";
/// let after = "line 1\nnew\nline 3";

/// // Plain unified diff for a single replacement
/// let plain = Diff::build_unified_diff(path, before, "old", "new", 2);
/// assert!(plain.contains("--- example.txt"));
/// assert!(plain.contains("+++ example.txt"));
/// assert!(plain.contains("-old"));
/// assert!(plain.contains("+new"));
///
/// // Colorized unified diff for displaying in the TUI
/// let colored = Diff::build_colored_unified_diff(path, before, "old", "new", 2);
/// assert!(colored.contains("\u{1b}[91m") || colored.contains("-old")); // red for removals, or plain if stripped
